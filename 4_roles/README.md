Create a Role Called baseline in /etc/ansible/roles.. this is present in our folder /etc

Create the structure needed for the role:

cd /etc/ansible/roles/
sudo mkdir baseline && sudo chown ansible.ansible /etc/ansible/roles/baseline
mkdir /etc/ansible/roles/baseline/{templates,tasks,files}
echo "---" > baseline/tasks/main.yml
Configure the Role to Deploy the /etc/motd Template
Copy the file:

cp /home/ansible/resources/motd.j2 baseline/templates
Create a file called deploy_motd.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/deploy_motd.yml
Add the following content:

---
- template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Open main.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/main.yml
Add the following lines to the file:

- name: configure motd
  import_tasks: deploy_motd.yml
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Configure the Role to Install the Latest Nagios Client
Find the package we need to install by reading a text file in our home directory:

cat /home/ansible/resources/nagios_info.txt
That file tells us the package we need to install is nrpe.x86_64.

Copy the IP of the Nagios server that's in the file and paste it into a text file, as we'll need it later.

Create a file, which will install the package, called deploy_nagios.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/deploy_nagios.yml
Add the following content:

---
- yum: name=nrpe state=latest
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Open main.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/main.yml
Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

- name: deploy nagios client
  import_tasks: deploy_nagios.yml
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Configure the Role to Add an Entry to /etc/hosts for the Nagios Server
Create a file called edit_hosts.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/edit_hosts.yml
Add the following content, substituting <IP_ADDRESS> with the Nagios server IP you copied earlier:

---
- lineinfile:
    line: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }} nagios.example.com" 
    path: /etc/hosts
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Open main.yml:

vim  baseline/tasks/main.yml
Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

- name: edit hosts file
  import_tasks: edit_hosts.yml
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Configure the Role to Create the noc User and Deploy the Provided Public Key for the noc User on Target Systems
Copy the provided authorized_keys file to our files directory:

cp /home/ansible/resources/authorized_keys /etc/ansible/roles/baseline/files/
Create a file called deploy_noc_user.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/deploy_noc_user.yml
Add the following content:

---
- user: name=noc
- file:
     state: directory
     path: /home/noc/.ssh
     mode: 0600
     owner: noc
     group: noc
- copy:
     src: authorized_keys
     dest: /home/noc/.ssh/authorized_keys
     mode: 0600
     owner: noc
     group: noc
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Open main.yml:

vim baseline/tasks/main.yml
Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

- name: set up noc user and key
  import_tasks: deploy_noc_user.yml
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Edit web.yml to Deploy the baseline Role
Change back to the home directory:

cd /home/ansible/
Open web.yml:

vim resources/web.yml
Edit it to match the following:

---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - baseline
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=latest
    - name: start and enable httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
Save and exit with Escape followed by :wq.

Run Your Playbook Using the Default Inventory
Deploy the playbook:

ansible-playbook resources/web.yml
Check Our Work
Log in to one of the nodes (the IP addresses are on the hands-on lab overview page):

ssh node1
We should see a new MOTD, so we know that play worked.

See if the noc user was set up:

id noc
Check to see if the nrpe package was installed:

sudo yum list nrpe
